## Current Task: Implement UTF8 Emotes/Icons for Commit Message Categories
**Status**: In Progress
**Started**: 2025-05-29 02:00
**Completed**: 2025-05-29 02:05

### Objective
Implement UTF8 emote categorization for commit messages to enhance visual appeal and categorization. Add commit message analysis, emote mapping, and integration into the commit generation flow.

### Requirements
1. Create commit message categorization logic to analyze and determine category
2. Implement emote mapping system with UTF8 emotes for different commit types
3. Modify LLM prompt to encourage categorization
4. Integrate emote addition into commit generation flow
5. Handle edge cases and maintain backward compatibility

### Implementation Plan
- [x] Analyze current codebase structure and existing emote usage
- [x] Create commit message categorization function
- [x] Implement comprehensive emote mapping system
- [x] Modify commit generation flow to add emotes
- [x] Update LLM prompts to encourage conventional commit format
- [x] Test with various commit message types
- [x] Ensure proper integration with existing filtering and splitting features

### Implementation Summary
- Created new `src/emotes.rs` module with comprehensive commit categorization system
- Implemented `CommitCategory` enum with 21 different commit types and their corresponding UTF8 emotes
- Added intelligent categorization logic that analyzes:
  1. Conventional commit format (type: description)
  2. Keyword analysis with priority-based matching
  3. Context analysis based on file patterns and paths
- Enhanced LLM prompts in `src/config.rs` to encourage conventional commit format
- Integrated emote processing into commit generation flow in `src/commands.rs`
- Added emote processing to combined commit messages in `src/llm.rs`
- Implemented comprehensive test suite with 12 test cases covering all functionality
- All emote-related tests passing successfully

## Previous Task: Implement Large Diff Splitting Functionality
**Status**: Completed
**Started**: 2025-05-29 01:56
**Completed**: 2025-05-29 01:59

### Objective
Implement large diff splitting functionality to handle cases where git diffs are too large for LLM context limits.

### Requirements
1. Add diff size checking and splitting logic in src/git.rs
2. Modify command processing flow in src/commands.rs
3. Implement message combination logic
4. Add error handling and fallback mechanisms
5. Support progressive splitting: files → hunks → character chunks

### Implementation Plan
- [x] Examine current diff handling in git.rs and commands.rs
- [x] Add split_large_diff() function with size threshold checking
- [x] Implement progressive splitting strategy
- [x] Modify generate_commit() to handle multiple LLM calls
- [x] Create message combination logic
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling
- [x] Test with various large diff scenarios

### Implementation Summary
- Added `DIFF_SIZE_THRESHOLD` constant (8000 characters) and `MAX_SPLIT_ATTEMPTS` (4)
- Created `DiffChunk` and `SplitDiffResult` structures for managing split diffs
- Implemented `split_large_diff()` with progressive splitting strategies:
  1. Split by files first (most logical)
  2. Split by hunks if files are still too large
  3. Split by character chunks (half threshold)
  4. Split by smaller character chunks (quarter threshold)
- Added `combine_commit_messages()` function in llm.rs to intelligently merge multiple commit messages
- Modified `generate_commit()` in commands.rs to detect large diffs and handle splitting/combination
- Added comprehensive test coverage for all new functionality
- All new tests passing, functionality verified

## Previous Task: Implement Comprehensive LLM Output Filtering
**Status**: Completed
**Started**: 2025-05-29 01:52
**Completed**: 2025-05-29 01:55

### Objective
Enhance the existing filtering in src/llm.rs to remove unwanted lines from AI-generated commit messages with comprehensive keyword/phrase patterns.

### Requirements
1. Extend current filtering logic in generate_commit_message() function
2. Create comprehensive list of keywords/phrases indicating unwanted LLM output
3. Add new filter_unwanted_lines() function with pattern matching
4. Preserve valid commit message content while filtering meta-commentary

### Target Patterns to Filter
- "The `diff`", "diff indicates", "Here's a breakdown"
- "analysis of the changes", "Based on the diff", "Looking at the changes"
- "The changes show", "This commit", "I can see", "From the diff"
- Lines that are LLM meta-commentary rather than actual commit content

### Progress
- [x] Analyze current filtering logic (lines 93-98 in src/llm.rs)
- [x] Implement comprehensive filter_unwanted_lines() function
- [x] Enhance existing filtering in generate_commit_message()
- [x] Test filtering with various patterns
- [x] Verify valid content preservation
- [x] All filtering tests passing successfully

### Implementation Summary
- Added filter_unwanted_lines() function with 40+ unwanted patterns
- Enhanced generate_commit_message() to use comprehensive filtering
- Implemented conservative filtering approach to preserve valid content
- Added comprehensive test suite with edge cases
- All tests passing, functionality verified

## Previous Task: Codebase Analysis
**Status**: Completed
**Completed**: 2025-05-29 01:52

### Summary
Successfully analyzed the codebase structure and identified the current basic filtering logic that only handles `</think>` tags. Ready to implement comprehensive filtering enhancement.
